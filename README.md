## What are tester.jar and javalib.jar?
I use [Benjamin Lerner](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/benjamin-lerner/)'s tester library (`tester.jar`) to test my code, as well as his image library (`javalib.jar`) to render it! To use these libraries, include them in whatever project contains these .java files as an external jar. To run the program, set your run configurations to use `tester.Main` as the main class, with the name of the `ExamplesAutomata` class as the program argument.
